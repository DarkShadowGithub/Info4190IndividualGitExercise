# Info4190IndividualGitExercise
This is a GitHub repository for Info4190's Git Individual Exercise. It will house a simple Java program with six different branches (five for different features and one for the master).
The Java program I have decided to make is a simple calculator.
The Calculator file, when run, will ask you for two numbers. If you input an invalid answer, it will ask you to type a new answer. 
Once you have input your two numbers, it will then ask you if you want to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Type in 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, or 4 for division. 
If you input an invalid answer, it will have you type in a new one. Once that is done, it will give you a result based on the options chosen. 
It will then ask you if you want to use the calculator again. If you type y, it will continue, but if you type anything else, the program will end.
This is the Subtraction file. It automatically subtracts the two numbers passed to it from the Subtraction function in the Calculator File. 
Then it passes it back to be displayed.
